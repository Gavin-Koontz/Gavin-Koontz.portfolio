            Hello, my name is Gavin Koontz. I grew up as a cattle and row crop
            farmer. At a young age, I began to develop an interest in
            technology. As my family noticed that I was a "Tech Genius," I was
            the one they called when they had tech problems, whether it be a
            simple restart of the computer or help with their spreadsheet - I
            was the go-to person.<br><br> My first 'coding' experience involved messing
            around with Windows cmd and PowerShell. I had a lot of fun
            with these, but my most enjoyable and well-understood experience was
            with HTML. I started creating random little websites all the time.
            Alongside my tech adventures, I was also very creative and
            frequently engaged in art creation.<br><br> As I grew older, I realized that
            web development involved a lot of coding and creativity - this is
            what I wanted to do. Today, I am pursuing a degree in web
            development while still managing my family farm and creating art on
            the side. Welcome to my portfolio.

                <h2>HTML CSS & JavaScript</h2>
                <p>
                    <hr>My interest in HTML started when I was young, and I began tinkering with it to create basic
                    websites just for the fun of it. As time passed, I grew more familiar with HTML and CSS, and now I
                    have a solid grasp of both. Currently, I'm a college student taking courses that dive into the
                    details of these important web technologies, and I'm performing well in my studies.
                    Besides my formal education, I'm also actively exploring web development on my own. I've been
                    focusing on learning JavaScript, and I've become quite comfortable with its fundamental concepts.
                    This mix of structured learning and self-guided exploration has not only expanded my knowledge but
                    also solidified my determination to excel in the world of web development. <a href="Projects.html#HTML5">HTML5 Projects</a>

                <h2>Python</h2>

                <p>
                    <hr>Learning Python has been an enjoyable experience for me. I had a clear intention to explore a
                    backend
                    programming language, and my college advisor suggested I try their Python course. Discovering the
                    capabilities of the Python language has been a delight. While I must admit that learning Python was
                    a bit more challenging compared to my previous experience with HTML5, it hasn't dampened my
                    enthusiasm. In fact, it has only fueled my determination to delve deeper into this versatile
                    language. <a href="Projects.html#PYTHON">Python Projects</a>

                    <hr>
                    Git and GitHub have been a complete game-changer for me. I had heard about Git and its capabilities,
                    but I never fully grasped how to utilize it effectively. It wasn't until I took my Python class that
                    I was taught how to use Git and GitHub. I'm truly amazed at how straightforward it is to update and
                    manage my projects using Git and Git repositories. Nowadays, I incorporate Git into nearly every
                    project I work on, <b>including this website!</b> It has become an indispensable
                    tool in my daily workflow, and I continue to discover new ways to make my coding life easier with
                    it.

                Learning Photoshop has been an enjoyable experience for me. While I dabbled with it for small projects before, 
                it wasn't until I took a college class in Photoshop that my skills truly flourished! Since then,
                 I've worked on various projects, and I can now say with confidence that I've become quite skilled 
                 in the realm of graphic design using Photoshop. <a href="Projects.html#PHOTOSHOP"> Photoshop Projects</a>

              <p><hr>
                
                I've been using Procreate for a considerable amount of time. While my passion initially lay in sketching on paper
                 and later transitioned to painting on canvas, incorporating Procreate into my artistic journey significantly elevated
                  my skills! With Procreate, I find myself creating designs and illustrations at a pace ten times faster. 
                  The joy I derive from using Procreate is immense, and I've developed considerable proficiency in designing within this software. 
                  Purchasing my iPad and embracing Procreate has proven to be an invaluable decision, opening up a world of creative possibilities 
                  that I'll never regret. <a href="Projects.html#PROCREATE">Procreate Projects</a>
