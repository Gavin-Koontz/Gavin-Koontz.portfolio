            Hello, my name is Gavin Koontz. I grew up as a cattle and row crop
            farmer. At a young age, I began to develop an interest in
            technology. As my family noticed that I was a "Tech Genius," I was
            the one they called when they had tech problems, whether it be a
            simple restart of the computer or help with their spreadsheet - I
            was the go-to person.<br><br> My first 'coding' experience involved messing
            around with Windows cmd, batch, and PowerShell. I had a lot of fun
            with these, but my most enjoyable and well-understood experience was
            with HTML. I started creating random little websites all the time.
            Alongside my tech adventures, I was also very creative and
            frequently engaged in art creation.<br><br> As I grew older, I realized that
            web development involved a lot of coding and creativity - this is
            what I wanted to do. Today, I am pursuing a degree in web
            development while still managing my family farm and creating art on
            the side. Welcome to my portfolio.
