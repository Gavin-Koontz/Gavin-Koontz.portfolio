        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Greetings! I'm Gavin Koontz, and I have a unique background. Growing up on a family farm, I discovered my passion for technology at an early age. As the designated "Tech Genius" in my family, I was the one they turned to for all things tech-related, from simple computer fixes to spreadsheet assistance.
    
            My journey into the world of coding began with playful experimentation in Windows command prompt, batch scripting, and PowerShell. However, it was HTML that truly captured my imagination. I found myself creating websites just for the fun of it, blending my innate tech curiosity with my artistic creativity.
    
            Over the years, I came to the realization that web development seamlessly combines the world of coding and creativity. It's the path I was meant to follow. Today, I'm on a quest to earn a degree in web development while still actively managing our family farm and dedicating time to my art.
    
            Welcome to my portfolio, where you'll find a showcase of my journey and creative endeavors.
