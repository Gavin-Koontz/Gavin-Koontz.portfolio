                            Here is a site that I created for a clients axe throwing business. The business is located in Saint Elmo Illinois,
                            owned and ran by Dustin Rhodes Forged in Fire contestant. The website includes store hours, reviews, pricing, 
                            and a biograghy of Dustin.

                            Here is a side project that I worked on for a couple hours a day. I followed a tutorial for
                            some parts of
                            the project. I used html to create the elements css to shape and colorize them, and finnally
                            I used javascript to
                            create the function of finding the time and creating the motion of the clock hands moving!

                            Here is a basic mock up site for a resturant named 'Pizza Street.' This is purly a simple
                            functionality example.
                            I created this to practice my html and css. The way I made it it works well on mobile
                            devices, it had multiple
                            pages: a home page with the menue and 'about us' section, an ordering page, a locations
                            page, and an application page
                            as well.

                        <h2> SportsXtreme Magazine Cover</h2>
                        <p>
                            In my Photoshop class, I created a cohesive magazine cover by merging multiple images. I
                            used many filters, fonts, and techniques throughout my design. Specifically, I used
                            hand-painted shadows beneath the skateboarder. The text placement and visual depth were most
                            prominent in the title and were accomplished by using many layers. This mock-up creation was
                            an enjoyable challenge of design techniques, from image merging to typography. This project
                            blended my creativity with digital art.

                        <h2> Midnight Suns Album Cover</h2>
                        <p>
                            In 'Midnight Sun,' I used a nighttime shot and added a sun and Rock and Roll sign in the
                            back. This imagery was added to mirror the name of the band and to highlight the genre of
                            music. The background photos were added separately. I seamlessly merged the nighttime sky
                            and mountain images while also adding texture to the mountain layer. I then added the album
                            and band name text using a font that contributed to the theme of the design. I finished the
                            design by adding a parental advisory sticker at the bottom right.

                            This project was centered around designing a promotional card for a city. In the background,
                            the row of lights began in the center. I moved them to the left side and blurred the
                            surroundings. Then I added in the 'BLVD' text as well as the event description. The project
                            instructions provided three images to choose from. The image to the right, a crate of
                            oranges, was one of the images provided. I then adjusted the image by including a border and
                            added a slight rotation to the image.

                            This project was created to share events coming up on 'CAC' calendar. This projects main focus was on the ballerina.
                            The ballerina in the front was originaly attached to the image in the back. I seperated the two and added some filters to 
                            the ballarinas in the back. I posisioned some fireworks in the top area of the advertisement. The last things I did on the
                            project was add in the text aswell as the banner and branding. The image was also resized into a square to let it work well 
                            on an instagram post.
