                <p>
                    <hr>My interest in HTML started when I was young, and I began tinkering with it to create basic
                    websites just for the fun of it. As time passed, I grew more familiar with HTML and CSS, and now I
                    have a solid grasp of both. Currently, I'm a college student taking courses that dive into the
                    details of these important web technologies, and I'm performing well in my studies.
                    Besides my formal education, I'm also actively exploring web development on my own. I've been
                    focusing on learning JavaScript, and I've become quite comfortable with its fundamental concepts.
                    This mix of structured learning and self-guided exploration has not only expanded my knowledge but
                    also solidified my determination to excel in the world of web development.

                <p>
                    <hr>Learning Python has been an enjoyable experience for me. I had a clear intention to explore a
                    backend
                    programming language, and my college advisor suggested I try their Python course. Discovering the
                    capabilities of the Python language has been a delight. While I must admit that learning Python was
                    a bit more challenging compared to my previous experience with HTML5, it hasn't dampened my
                    enthusiasm. In fact, it has only fueled my determination to delve deeper into this versatile
                    language.

                    Git and GitHub have been a complete game-changer for me. I had heard about Git and its capabilities,
                    but I never fully grasped how to utilize it effectively. It wasn't until I took my Python class that
                    I was taught how to use Git and GitHub. I'm truly amazed at how straightforward it is to update and
                    manage my projects using Git and Git repositories. Nowadays, I incorporate Git into nearly every
                    project I work on, <b>including this website!</b> It has become an indispensable
                    tool in my daily workflow, and I continue to discover new ways to make my coding life easier with
                    it.
