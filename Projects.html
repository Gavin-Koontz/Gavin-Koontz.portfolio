                        <h2> SportsXtreme Magazine Cover</h2>
                        <p>
                            In my Photoshop class, I created a cohesive magazine cover by merging multiple images. I
                            used
                            many filters, fonts,and techniques throughout my design. Specifically I used hand painted
                            shadows beneath the skateboarder.
                            The text placement and visual depth was most prominent in the title and was accomplished by
                            using many layers. This mock-up creation was an enjoyable challange of
                            design
                            techniques, from image merging to typography. This project blended my creativity with
                            digital
                            art.

                        <h2> Midnight Suns Album Cover</h2>
                        <p>
                             In "Midnight Sun" I used a nightime shot and added a sun and Rock and Roll sign in the back. 
                             This imagery was added to mirror the name of the band and to highlihgt the genre of music. 
                            The background photos were added seperately I seamlessly merged the nighttime sky and moutain images, while
                            also adding texture to the mountains layer. I then added in the album and band name text using a font that
                            added to the theme of the design. I finished the design by adding a parental advisory sticker at the bottom right.

                            <p>
                                This project was centered around desinging a promotional card for a city. 
                                In the background, the row of lights began in the center. I moved them to the left side and blurred the surroundings.
                                 Then I added in the 'BLVD' text aswell as the event description.
                                 The project instructions provided three images to choose from. The image to the right, a crate of oranges was one of the images provided. 
                                 I then adjusted the image by including a border and added a slight rotation to the image.
